This is my own implemented algorithms for major data structures
and  common operations.
Please create these seriously as it will be used in future.
Algorithms for sorting , binary tree, hash table etc.

Be patient and work hard.
Do not choose shortcuts.
Create full algorithms. DON'T USE LIBRARY.

YOU HAVE TO REFER TO THIS PROJECT MULTIPLE TIMES SO DON'T
