A heap is special tree based structure in which tree is complete binary tree.
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
Binary heaps are binary trees having special order.
Those can be classified based on 2 types Max-heap and Min-heap.
Heaps are of 2 types:
1. Max-heap:
In Max-heap key present at the root node is greatest in the tree. The same applies recursively to all the
subtrees.

2. Min-heap:
In Min-heap key present at root node is minimum in value. The same applies recursively to all the subtrees.

Thus in order to perform heapsort we first need to heapify our tree.
This can be done using recursion.
