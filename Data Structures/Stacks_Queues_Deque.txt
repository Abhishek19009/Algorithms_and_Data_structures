Last in First Out
Much like stack of plates.
One that is added is first one to be removed.

1. push - append element at front ( constant time)
2. pop - remove element from front ( constant time)

QUEUE:-

Queue works on principle of FIFO
First in First OUt
Much like people in line for collecting movie tickets
First one to get is the first one out.
