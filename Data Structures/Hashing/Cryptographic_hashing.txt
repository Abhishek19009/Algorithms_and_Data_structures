Cryptographic hashing is special in a way that it employs a special hash function that has following the properties:-

1. ONE-WAY (OW):- Very hard to reverse.
2. Collision-resistant (CR):- Infeasible to find x', x s.t x != x' and h(x) != h(x'). This is a collision, two input values have same hash.

3. Target collision-resistance (TCR):- Infeasible given x to find x' = x s.t h(x) = h(x')

TCR is weaker than CR. If a hash function satisfies CR it will satisfy TCR.

APPLICATIONS:-

1. Password Storage
2. File modification detector
3. Digital signatures
