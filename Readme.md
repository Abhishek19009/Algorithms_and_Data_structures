# Python code implementation of common Data_structures and common Algorithms

The work here is serious.
Don't add unnecessary files in repository.
All important Data_structures included.

I have skipped Integer Arithmetic and High precision 
multiplication, division, and square root for now 
since I am focussing more on traditional algorithms.
Cover them later.

Graph theory is heavily applied in computer science 
and all the later algorithms in MIT course like
Djkitra, breadth first search, depth first search is to 
be learnt after learning graph theory.
Even DP employs graph theory so go in details of graph 
theory.

Read Graph theory from Introduction to Algorithms 
book.
(that would give much thorough analysis rather than 
watching youtube video)
