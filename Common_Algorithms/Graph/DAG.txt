Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph with directed edges and no cycles.
By this definition all trees are DAGs since they don't contain cycles.

One of the greatest property in DAG is finding shortest path which have time complexity of O(V+E).
Also, finding longest path in DAG is not NP-hard and can be done in complexity of O(V+E).
