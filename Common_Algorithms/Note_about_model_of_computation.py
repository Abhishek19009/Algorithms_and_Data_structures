"""
In different models of computation there always lies a lower bound for that model of computation.
Ex- Binary Search, BST Sorting, AVL search, merge sort, insertion sort all belongs under
similar model of computation i.e "Comparison model".
It's because in all these operations we do comparison of the elements in the data structure.
And that's what is the meat and potato of these algorithms.

In Comparison model:
Searching has lower bound of logn
Sorting has lower bound of nlogn

Remember lower bounds depend on model of computation.
If we choose a different model of computation lower bounds can change.

In RAM model:

Sorting has linear lower bound.
It's because in all these operations we do comparison of the elements in the data structure.
And that's what the meat and potato of these algorithms.
