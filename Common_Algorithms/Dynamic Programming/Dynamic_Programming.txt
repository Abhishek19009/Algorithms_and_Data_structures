Dynamic Programming:

1. Memoize (remember) and re-use solutions to sub-problems that help solve the actual problem.

In general, sub-problems might not be clearly observable.
That's the hardest of Dynamic Programming.

Time Complexity of Dynamic Programming = (Number of Sub-problems)*(time taken per sub-problem)
